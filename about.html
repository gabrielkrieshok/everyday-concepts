<p>Everyday Concepts are an ongoing effort to unpack and explore useful concepts, ideas, and mental models that crop up (or ought to) in our lives.</p>
<p>I am working on a book of these concepts that further explore how to visualize them and their relevance to everyday life.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am developing a weekly podcast with special guests that explore one concept in more depth. Follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielkrieshok">@gabrielkrieshok</a> to stay tuned.</p>
<p>Defined, sketched, and produced by me, <a href="https://gabrielkrieshok.com/">Gabriel Krieshok.</a></p>
